# card-from-api
Example of fetch'ing via card-api.

This ended up being an example for the solitaire game Klondike (7-kabale p√• dansk).

I wanted to test if my API worked with a "real life" project, and since the solitaire game works as expected, the conclusion is that the API also works as expected.
